He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.<a class="moretag" href="http://demo.pukkathemes.com/sympagrid/text-only/" title="Text only" target="_self"> &#8594; </a>]]></description>

<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. &#8220;What&#8217;s happened to me?&#8221; he thought. It wasn&#8217;t a dream.</p>
<p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table &#8211; Samsa was a travelling salesman &#8211; and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops</p>

“The Golden Rules For Houseguests</p>
<p>There is more to being a good houseguest than just being nice and doing your part to help out. And family members, take note: Guest manners are called for, even when you stay with relatives. Here are some important things to consider when you plan to stay over at someone’s home:</p>
<p>Definitely Do…</p>
<p>    make your visit short and sweet. Generally keep your visit to no more than three nights.<br />
    bring your own toiletries.<br />
    make your bed and clean up after yourself. Keep your bathroom clean: Wipe up any ring in the tub, shaving cream residue in the basin, hair on any object or surface, or dirt on soap.<br />
    offer to help out, especially in the kitchen (unless your host objects).<br />
    be adaptable. Be ready for anything—or for nothing.<br />
    show that you’re enjoying yourself.<br />
    offer to pitch in for groceries if you are staying more than two or three nights.<br />
    double check to make sure you have all your belongings before you leave.<br />
    bring or send a gift, or treat your host to a night out.<br />
    send a handwritten thank-you note following your visit.</p>
<p>Definitely Don’t…</p>
<p>    ask to bring your pet. If you must travel with your pet, inquire about a good kennel in the area or offer to stay in a hotel. This also gives your host an opening to invite your pet if they wish.<br />
    accept an invitation from someone else during your visit without first checking with your host.<br />
    use your host’s phone, computer, or any other equipment without asking.<br />
    use more than your share of hot water.<br />
    snoop.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that sympa is the most commonly used adjective in Paris? Initially, sympa is short for sympathique and translated to english it means &#8220;nice&#8221;. People, places, moments, activities can all be sympa. Being fantastically non-committing, ‘sympa‘ grew to become tremendously popular an adjective.  In Paris, there is really only one answer to the question “C’était comment ?” <strong>Sympa!</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-1"></span></p>
<p>There is sympa song from Serbian singer Bajaga and it goes like this:</p>
<p><em>La musique c&#8217;est fantastique</em><br />
<em>prepare la revolution </em><br />
<em>et la femme est tres jolie </em><br />
<em>tre jolie comme un bonbon</em></p>
